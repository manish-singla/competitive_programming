## One Machine, Two Jobs

We begin the discussion with the simplest scheduling problem: You go to Park 'n Shop to buy a can of Coke. At the check-out counter, just before you, is a lady with a large basket of groceries. The lady allows you to go ahead of her, pay for your coke in 1/2 min, and then presents her basket to the clerk who takes 5 min to check and bag her order.

This lady was using a well known rule for scheduling single processor systems: Scheduling shortest job first will result in minimum average (and total) waiting time.

In the example above, if the system worked as First-Come, First-Served, then the total waiting time would be = 0 min for the lady + 5 min for you = 5 min.

If you go first, then the total waiting time = 0 min for you + 1/2 min for her = 1/2 min !

## Two Machine Cases:

The mathematics is much more difficult as soon as we start to schedule two machine systems.
